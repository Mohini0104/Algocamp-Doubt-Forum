_Community-driven javascript doubt forum, to help you get answers to your questions and overcome any doubts you may have regarding JavaScript and related technologies._ üå±

## **Hello and welcome to our Algocamp JavaScript community!**

We know that sometimes we have doubts or questions regarding JavaScript or related technologies that are being discussed in the cohorts, So to each other in this journey and to make the process of asking questions and getting answers easier and more efficient, we have created this doubt form.

Here are some guidelines for using this form:

‚ú® Please be specific: When asking a question, try to be as specific as possible. This will help others understand exactly what you're asking and provide better answers.

‚ú®Use clear language: Avoid using jargon or technical terms that others may not understand. Use clear and concise language to ensure your question is easy to comprehend.

‚ú®Check previous questions: Before asking a new question, take a moment to check if someone has already asked a similar question. You may find the answer you're looking for without needing to ask again.

‚ú®Be respectful: Our community is made up of people from all walks of life, and we value respect and civility. Please be respectful and courteous in your interactions with others.

‚ú®Provide context: If you're having an issue with code or a project, provide as much context as possible. This could include code snippets, screenshots, or a description of your project.

‚ú®Use proper formatting: When sharing code or snippets, please use proper formatting to ensure it's easy to read and understand. You can use tools like CodePen or JSFiddle to share your code.

‚ú®Be patient: Our community is made up of volunteers who may not be available to answer your question immediately. Please be patient and wait for a response.

By following these guidelines, we hope to create a welcoming and helpful community where everyone can learn and grow. Thank you for being a part of our **JavaScript community!**
